Shiftie is a new site who's proposing to users to post their recipes and to vote for others users' recipes, all that to promote the most voted recipe on the homepage for 24H.

You can also create your own cookbook which will be available on the website or the mobile app!<br/>

You can also log in to post your first recipe, let's go!</div>
